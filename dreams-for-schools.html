                    I created personas, user journey maps, designed the information architecture as well as the

                    <br> <br>
                    As a solution, we developed an

                <p class="proj-text"> Following agile methodology, we worked in two-week sprints.
                    To organize our workflow, we consolidated the list of requirements by organizing tasks by type,
                    then assigning priorities to each task in a projected schedule. The sprints allowed us to work
                    iteratively on the product and remain flexible during the process. <br> <br>

                    Communication played a major role in agile development. To set clear expectations between
                    us and Dreams For Schools, we held weekly meetings as well as asynchronous communication
                    via Slack for pressing clarification questions. This allowed us to be transparent
                    about our progress, communicate issues and needs, and facilitate teamwork.</p>

                    We started by grouping various pieces of data together, eventually forming different "categories" of
                    information.

                    The tag colors were made red and green so their meanings could be easily discerned. We also made
                    improvements to the filtering feature, making each attribute accessible in less clicks.
                    This final design would allow the users to easily identify all the necessary information about

                    studying the codebase and understanding how data was stored in the backend, we were able to

                    meant that my design process didn’t start with a blank slate like some of my previous experiences.
                    Instead, I had to design features on an already existing system that needed many improvements.
                    This taught me to be comfortable working with existing limitations.

                    we met with each other multiple times a week, reflected on our momentum through sprint reports,
                    and met with our nonprofit stakeholders weekly. This process taught me to be understanding of my
                    team members’ roles and how to effectively convey my ideas to stakeholders without design backgrounds.
